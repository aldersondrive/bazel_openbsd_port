Bazel is a declarative, multilanguage build tool. It is the open-source
version of the build tool that Google uses internally.

An example configuration file has been installed as
/usr/local/share/examples/bazel/bazel.bazelrc. You may wish to copy this file
to /etc/bazel.bazelrc.

Known limitations:

- Running Bazel to build/test Java code requires a
  --host_javabase=@local_jdk//:jdk flag.

- Sandboxing is unsupported.
