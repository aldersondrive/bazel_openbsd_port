Bazel is a declarative, multilanguage build tool.

An example configuration file is available as
/usr/local/share/examples/bazel/bazel.bazelrc. You may wish to copy this file
to /etc/bazel.bazelrc, to ~/.bazelrc, or to .bazelrc at the root of your
Bazel workspace tree.

Known limitations:

- Running Bazel to build/test Java code requires a
  --extra_toolchains=@local_jdk//:all flag. This flag can be set automatically
  via a configuration file (see above).

- If JAVA_HOME is unset, the `bazel` binary defaults to using the JDK in
  /usr/local/jdk-17. To use a different JDK, set JAVA_HOME.

- Sandboxing is unsupported.
